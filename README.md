# ALX
This a Data Analyst Nanodegree program taken on the Udacity e-learning platform and sponsored by ALX. 

The program is divided into two main sections
- Learning Data Analysis Concepts and Implementing Projects
- Career Services Focusing on Self and Work Prresentation

The first has three main parts
1. Introduction to Data Analysis
2. Data Wrangling
3. Data Visualization.

For each of the three sections listed above, there is a project to be implemented to prove understanding of
the different concepts thought in the modules of each section.

## Introduction to Data Analysis
This phase of the program aims at
- listing out different tools used for data analysis
- teaching the steps of a data analysis process
- making sure students understand the data analysis workflow
- showing different data analysis case studies/examples

### Investigating a Dataset.
This is the very first project of this course and one is expected to 
- choose from a set of different datasets, 
- investigate the chosen dataset
- communicate any insights.

Note that this is an intro project and students are not expected to portray pro data analysis skills but it serves
as an intro the world of data analysis and it capabilities.

My intention here is to investigate all the available data sets.
